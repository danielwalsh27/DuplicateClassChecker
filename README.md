# CSUF-TDA-C.3-Z



Cal State Fullerton has a Titan Degree Audit that is used to track the students academic status. 
There are many classes availbe in each catagory, in fact some classes are in multiple catagories and can double count
I have two categories left to complete, C.3 and Z.
A quick eye test showed me they had similar classes so I created a program to match all the classes that suffice for both.


Also showed implementation for Array, Hash Set(unordered_set), Hash Table(unordered_map), Self-Balancing (RB)Tree(map).
